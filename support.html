                <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>How do I install TigerFlow?</h3>
                <p>Install TigerFlow directly from the Webflow Designer Apps panel. Once installed, it will appear in your extensions list and can be launched on any page.</p>

                <h3>Is my content data safe?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! TigerFlow performs all analysis locally in your browser. No data is ever sent to external servers, collected, or stored. Your content remains completely private.</p>

                <h3>What is the SEO score based on?</h3>
                <p>The SEO score is calculated based on multiple factors including meta tags, content length, keyword usage, heading structure, readability, and link analysis. Each factor is weighted according to current SEO best practices.</p>

                <h3>How do I set a focus keyword?</h3>
                <p>Simply type your target keyword in the "Focus Keyword" field at the top of the TigerFlow panel. The extension will automatically analyze how well your page is optimized for that keyword.</p>

                <h3>Why isn't my SEO score updating?</h3>
                <p>Click the refresh button (‚Üª) in the top right of the TigerFlow panel to re-analyze your page. The extension analyzes your page when it loads, but manual refresh ensures you see the latest changes.</p>

                <h3>What do the different recommendation types mean?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Error (Red):</strong> Critical issues that should be fixed immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Warning (Yellow):</strong> Important improvements that will help your SEO</li>
                    <li><strong>Info (Blue):</strong> Suggestions for optimization</li>
                    <li><strong>Success (Green):</strong> Things you're doing well</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Can I use TigerFlow on published sites?</h3>
                <p>TigerFlow is designed specifically for the Webflow Designer environment. It analyzes pages while you're building them, helping you optimize before publishing.</p>

                <h3>How accurate are the readability scores?</h3>
                <p>TigerFlow uses the Flesch Reading Ease formula, a widely-accepted standard for measuring text readability. While it's a helpful guide, remember that readability also depends on your target audience.</p>
                
                <h3>Why can't TigerFlow analyze my entire site at once?</h3>
                <p>This is due to Webflow's Designer Extension API limitations. Extensions can only access the currently open page in Designer, and analysis stops when you close the extension. This is a security feature by design - Webflow restricts bulk access to protect your site. <strong>Solution:</strong> Use our Bulk Analysis feature (Pro) which builds a comprehensive site audit as you navigate through pages.</p>
                
                <h3>How does the Smart Link Assistant work?</h3>
                <p>The Smart Link Assistant (Pro/Business) helps you build better internal linking by providing link health analysis, orphaned page detection, smart suggestions based on content relevance, and anchor text optimization warnings. It builds a "link graph" of your site as you analyze pages, getting smarter over time.</p>
                
                <h3>What's the difference between Free, Pro, and Business tiers?</h3>
                <p>Free gives you basic SEO analysis for up to 10 pages per month. Pro ($12/mo) adds unlimited pages, E-E-A-T analysis, Smart Link Assistant, bulk analysis, and CSV exports. Business ($29/mo) includes everything in Pro plus schema markup generation, white label options, and priority support. Check our <a href="pricing.html">pricing page</a> for full details.</p>

                <h3>Can I use TigerFlow on published sites?</h3>
                <p>No, TigerFlow is designed specifically for the Webflow Designer environment. It analyzes pages while you're building them, helping you optimize before publishing. For published site analysis, export your TigerFlow reports and use them alongside tools like Google Search Console.</p>
                
                <h3>How do I export my SEO reports?</h3>
                <p>With Pro or Business tiers, you can export reports by clicking the Export buttons at the top of the TigerFlow panel. Pro users can export to CSV format, while Business users get CSV, PDF, and JSON options. These reports include all analysis data for the current page.</p>
